Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
=======================

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Contents
- this **README.md**
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work called **CodeBook.md**
- R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following. 
	- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
